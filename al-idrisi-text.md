# Al-Idrisi: Nuzhat al-Mushtaq fi Ikhtiraq al-Afaq (The Book of Roger / Tabula Rogeriana)

## About the Author

Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Idrisi (circa 1100-1166) was a renowned 12th-century Arab geographer, cartographer, and traveler from al-Maghrib (North Africa). He gained the attention of Norman King Roger II (reigned 1130–54) of Sicily, who commissioned al-Idrisi to produce his masterpiece geographical work.

## About the Work

**Full Title:** Nuzhat al-mushtaq fi ikhtiraq al-afaq
**Also Known As:**
- Tabula Rogeriana (Latin: "The Book of Roger")
- "Recreation for he who wishes to travel the world" or "The Pleasure of One Who Wishes to Traverse the Regions of the World"
- Kitab Rugari (Book of Roger)

**Completed:** 1154 CE / 548 AH
**Commissioner:** King Roger II of Sicily

## Description of the Work

This geography describes the people, settlements, flora, fauna, and geography of lands stretching from sub-Saharan Africa to Scandinavia and from Iberia to eastern Asia. The result, Nuzhat al-mushtaq, was a compendium of the socioeconomic, physical, cultural, and political conditions of the time, with 70 maps of population centers.

Al-Idrisi's work remained the most accurate map of the medieval world for approximately three centuries after its creation. It represents one of the most advanced medieval achievements in cartography and geography.

## Methodology

Al-Idrisi compiled his geographical knowledge from:
- Classical sources (Greek and Roman geographers)
- Arab geographical texts
- Reports from travelers and merchants
- His own extensive travels across the Mediterranean and beyond
- Information gathered specifically for King Roger II's commission

## Selected English Text Excerpts

### Description of England

"This [England] is an island resembling the head of an ostrich, and contains flourishing cities, lofty mountains, flowing rivers, and level ground. There is abundant fertility in it. Its inhabitants are hardy, resolute, and prudent."

### Geographic Details of Eastern England

"From the town of Gernemutha [Yarmouth] to the town of Norwicca [Norwich] is ninety miles. The town of Norwicca [Norwich] is distant ten miles from the sea, and from there to Grimsby is a hundred and fifty miles by sea. From the said town of Gernemutha [Yarmouth] the sea[-coast] curves round in a circle, but still tending northwards. From the said town of Grimsby to the town of Evrvic [York] is eighty miles."

### From the Preface

In his preface, Al-Idrisi describes how King Roger II desired to know about his own lands and those of neighboring territories, and commissioned the creation of this comprehensive geographical work along with a great silver planisphere showing the seven climates and their regions.

## Structure of the Work

The work is organized according to the classical Greek system of seven climates (latitudinal zones), with each climate further divided into ten sections, creating a systematic survey of the known world. Each section contains:
- Descriptions of cities and settlements
- Geographic features (mountains, rivers, seas)
- Distances between locations
- Economic activities and products
- Cultural and social observations
- Political conditions

## Significance

Al-Idrisi's Tabula Rogeriana represents:
1. The most accurate world map produced in the medieval period
2. A remarkable synthesis of classical, Islamic, and contemporary knowledge
3. An example of productive collaboration between Islamic scholars and Christian European rulers
4. A crucial source for understanding medieval geography, trade routes, and cultural exchange
5. Evidence of the advanced state of Arab geographic knowledge in the 12th century
